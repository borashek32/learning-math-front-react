In this module, your child will be able to independently solve various tasks, learning numbers and developing counting skills. Before starting to use the module, make sure that your child is registered in our application. Registration will allow to save progress and earn experience points (XP) for completing tasks. After successful registration and login to the application, your child will be able to access the preparation for school module. In this module, your child will learn numbers by solving various simple tasks. Tasks will include counting, comparing numbers, as well as basic arithmetic operations. Each completed task will earn your child experience points (XP). The more tasks your child completes, the more XP he or she will earn. Your child will be able to track progress in the module and see achievements. We will also celebrate his or her successes and encourage overcoming new mathematical challenges! We hope that your child will enjoy learning mathematics with the help of our preparation for school module! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact us."

These materials include interactive exercises, examples, and explanations to help children grasp mathematical concepts effectively. Additionally, users can track their child's progress and performance within the app, allowing for personalized learning experiences. As the app continues to evolve, additional school programs for other grade levels will be added, providing a comprehensive educational resource for children of all ages. Users will also be able to earn XP, which will reflect their progress in the app."
